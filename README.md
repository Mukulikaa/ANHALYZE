# ANHALIZE  (beta)

`ANHALIZE` is an analysis tool for the Arctic and Northern Hemisphere Atlantic (ANHA) configuration of the NEMO model. 
The focus is on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 

The code is currently under development for ANHA4 data. Other configurations planed for the future.

This tool has been originally developed to support ocean modeling research at the 
Centre for Earth Observation Science (CEOS), at the University of Manitoba.
